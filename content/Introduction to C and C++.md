Welcome to the introduction section of our C/C++ tutorial. In this section, we will cover the basics of these powerful programming languages.  

## What is C/C++?  

C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s. C++ is an extension of C that includes object-oriented features.  

## Sample Code  

Here's a simple C++ program that prints "Hello, World!":  

```cpp  
#include <iostream>  

int main() {  
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;  
    return 0;  
}  
```
